# Workflows

Repository for Flash-X Workflows. 

Categories of workflows that fall under management of this repository.

1. Data analysis workflows for research articles, papers, etc.
2. Machine learning workflows
3. Workflows using Flash-X container to run on cloud computing environments
4. HPC workflows for performance testing (this maybe dependent on how others want to do..)

Directory structure is organized based on ```source/Simulation/SimulationMain``` of Flash-X. With the idea that it may live as a submodule under ``source/Simulation/SimulationWorkflows```

### How To

Create a folder for your workflows at the level of specific simulation directory

- Add parfiles, performance logs, Maplefiles, Dockerfiles, API keys, and provide a README on your organization structure
